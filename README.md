The Global Food Analysis project aims to provide insights into global food consumption patterns and trends by analyzing a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset encompasses information on various food items across different countries.

The project addresses the need to understand and analyze global food consumption patterns to identify patterns, relationships and possible future developments. Using machine learning, the project aims to develop predictive models that can accurately predict future food prices based on historical data.
